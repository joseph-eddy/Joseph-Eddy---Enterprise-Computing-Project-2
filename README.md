Hello! In this file you will find the following:
- "Project 2 - Multithreading" - file containing all the sourcecode/output files for the program
- "Outline.docx" - my personal notes I took in preparation for this project
- "Screenshots.docx" - screenshots of program functioning (required for submission)
- "project2.pdf" - project description and requirements from professor

In this project, I utilized multithreading to simulate an online banking service that handles deposits, withdrawals, and audits. The program handles 17 infinitely-looping threads (10 withdrawal, 5 deposit, and 2 audit) where the amount of money in the transactions that occur are random. Deposits range from $1-500 and withdrawals from $1-99. The program will infinitely run until the user terminates it, and the output for the program will be contained in the "output.txt" file rather than the terminal or console. Any deposits over $350 and withdrawals over $75 will be flagged and placed in the "transaction.csv" file. For more information about the project scope and requirements, please read "project2.pdf"
